call.291.dialog.13	Ok, but what about the water?
call.291.dialog.14	It flows from the top and on the side. Almost like a river. Maybe some pipe cracked? Or maybe it's coming from the house that started collapsing when the shaking began, a bit higher.

call.291.dialog.16	I don't know about the basement, but it keeps flowing down there, right through the middle of my room! And there is mud too! I live downstairs where it's flat, so it all stays here. Sometimes even when it's raining... but now...
call.291.dialog.17	{TURN OFF BRAKER BOX} Ok ma'am you're gonna have to shut down your breaker box.
call.291.dialog.18	What?
call.291.dialog.19	The breaker box ma'am, so you don't get electrocuted.
call.291.dialog.20	But we don't have power at the moment. Nothings working! When it was shaking, it must have damaged the cables or something. It happens sometimes.

call.291.dialog.26	Oh... ok, what should I do then?
call.291.dialog.27	Shut off your breaker box.

call.291.dialog.29	Usually they are in a box near the entrance to the building.

call.291.dialog.31	Of course not.
call.291.dialog.32	Can you send someone over anyway? I can't sit here all day wet and without electricity. That's unbearable...
call.291.dialog.33	I will send a team as soon as I can.
call.291.dialog.34	Ok, but better be quick. The water is cold.
call.291.dialog.35	As soon as I can get them there ma'am.
call.291.dialog.36	What about the water?
